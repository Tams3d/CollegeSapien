## 📊 Syllabus Data & CSV Structure

The platform stores academic curricula in `data/syllabus/` as `.json` and `.csv` files. The CSV format is designed for easy editing via Excel or Google Sheets.

### CSV Layout Guidelines
Each row represents a single subject record. Common metadata fields (college, course, regulation, etc.) are repeated across every row to produce a self-contained flat file of 12 columns:

| Column Header | Data Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`college`** | String | The full name of the university or college. | `Anna University Affiliated` |
| **`college_code`** | String | The short identifier for the college. | `AUA` |
| **`course`** | String | The name of the academic department/program. | `Information Technology` |
| **`course_code`** | String | The program code mirroring the department. | `IT` |
| **`regulation`** | String | The academic curriculum regulation code. | `R2025` |
| **`semester`** | Number | The semester index (values `1` to `8`). | `1` |
| **`subject_code`** | String | The alphanumeric subject code. | `MA25C01` |
| **`subject_name`** | String | The full title of the subject. | `Applied Calculus` |
| **`credits`** | Number | The academic credits weight of the course. | `4` |
| **`category`** | String | Course category (e.g. Basic Sciences `BS`, Professional Core `PC`, or the elective stream title like `Artificial Intelligence`). | `BS` |
| **`elective_type`** | String/Null | The name of the elective pool slot for `option` records, or `null` for `core` records. | `Professional Elective I` |
| **`record_type`** | String | Subject status: `'core'` (mandatory) or `'option'` (choice from an elective pool). | `core` |
